## :two: Task 2: Customer Retention 
The telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we donâ€™t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that itâ€™s self-explanatory for our management

The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

1. Define proper KPIs
2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

balance at the executive management level, but theyâ€™re not seeing any progress. Theyâ€™re reaching out to us for help.

workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, 
diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome 
and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:
- #of men
- #of women
- #of leavers
- % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women

Your task is to do the following:

1. Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation
2. Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be
