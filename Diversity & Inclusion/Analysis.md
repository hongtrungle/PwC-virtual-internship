### 6. Recommendation
- There are gender imbalances in:
  - Some departments: Strategy and HR (the dominant side accounts for more than 70%)
  - High job levels: The higher job level is, the fewer women there are.
  - New hires in high job level: the proportion of men hiring dominates in higher job level.
  - Promtion: Among promoted employees, male employees predominate
- There should be actions towards these imbalances in both processes of hiring and promoting. 
- Improve performance by staying employees, especially the group having > 7 years in same job level and the group of over
50 years old.
