# ⌛  Case Study:  Customer Retention
The telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

1. Define proper KPIs
2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
